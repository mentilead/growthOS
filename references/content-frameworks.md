# Content Marketing Frameworks for Shopify Apps

## Core Frameworks

### PAS — Problem, Agitate, Solution
The most effective framework for Shopify app marketing because merchants are problem-aware and actively seeking solutions.

**Problem:** Name the specific pain point in merchant language. Be concrete — "losing sales to cart abandonment" not "marketing challenges."

**Agitate:** Quantify the cost of inaction. Use data when possible: "The average Shopify store loses 70% of carts. At your volume, that's $X,000/month walking out the door."

**Solution:** Position your app as the answer. Lead with the outcome, not the feature: "Recover 15-20% of abandoned carts automatically" not "Our app sends abandoned cart emails."

### AIDA — Attention, Interest, Desire, Action
Best for longer-form content like blog posts and landing pages.

**Attention:** Hook with a surprising stat, bold claim, or provocative question. "Why do 77% of new Shopify app installs churn within 3 days?"

**Interest:** Explain what makes your approach different from what they've tried before. Share a unique insight or methodology.

**Desire:** Show the outcome with specifics. Before/after metrics, merchant testimonials, case study results. Make them want it.

**Action:** Clear, single CTA. "Add the app to start your free trial" or "Read the full case study."

## Content Types for Shopify App Marketing

### 1. Problem-Solution Articles
- Target: Merchants searching for solutions to specific problems
- Format: "How to [solve problem] on Shopify"
- Funnel stage: Top-of-funnel (awareness)

### 2. How-To Guides
- Target: Merchants trying to accomplish a task
- Format: Step-by-step tutorial with screenshots

### 3. Comparison Content
- Target: Merchants evaluating solutions
- Format: "Best Shopify Apps for [Category]" or "[App A] vs [App B]"
- Funnel stage: Bottom-of-funnel (decision)
- SEO target: Category and competitor keywords

**Comparison content strategy:**

- Distribution: LinkedIn, Dev.to, Shopify Community
- Example: "What We Learned Analyzing 1,000 Shopify App Listings"

## SEO Strategy for App Developers

### Target Merchant Pain Points, Not App Features
Merchants don't search for "email automation tool" — they search for "how to recover abandoned carts on Shopify."

**Good keyword targets:**
- "[problem] shopify" — "reduce cart abandonment shopify"
- "how to [task] shopify" — "how to send wholesale pricing shopify"
- "best shopify apps for [category]" — "best shopify apps for B2B"
- "[competitor] alternative" — "[competitor name] alternative shopify"

**Bad keyword targets:**
- Your app name (no one searches for it yet)
- Generic feature terms ("email automation", "analytics dashboard")
- Developer-centric terms ("API integration", "webhook handler")

### Reddit + Google "Discussions and Forums" Trend
Google increasingly surfaces Reddit and forum content in search results via the "Discussions and Forums" section. This is a major 2025-2026 search trend.

**Strategy:**
- Be genuinely helpful on Reddit (r/shopify, r/ecommerce, r/shopifyappdev)
- Answer questions where your app is a natural solution — but lead with help, not promotion
- Your Reddit history IS your marketing — helpful answers get upvoted and found via Google
- Never post "check out my app" — instead, explain the solution and mention your app only if someone asks

## Content Calendar Template

### Monthly Themes
Align content with seasonal ecommerce patterns:
- January: New year planning, goal setting

- April-May: Summer prep, mid-year review
- June-July: Back-to-school prep (if relevant)
- August-September: BFCM preparation (critical for Shopify)
- October: BFCM final prep
- November: BFCM execution, holiday season
- December: Year-end review, next year planning
