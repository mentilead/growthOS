# Shopify App Store Ads & Paid Acquisition Guide

## Shopify App Store Ads

### How the Auction Works
- **CPC (cost-per-click) first-price auction:** You pay what you bid, not second-price
- **Quality score equivalent:** Highly relevant apps pay less and rank higher. Relevance is determined by app category, keywords, listing quality, and conversion rate
- **Implication:** A well-optimized listing with good conversion rates will get more impressions at lower cost than a poorly optimized competitor bidding higher

### Prerequisites — Don't Start Ads Until
| Requirement | Why |
|-------------|-----|
| 4.0+ star rating | Low ratings waste ad spend — merchants check reviews before clicking |
| 5+ reviews | No reviews = no social proof = low click-through rate |
| Validated conversion rate | Know your install rate is reasonable (20%+) before paying for traffic |
| Optimized listing | Fix your listing first — ads amplify what you already have (good or bad) |
| Clear unit economics | Know your ARPU so you can calculate acceptable CAC |

**If you don't meet these prerequisites:** Focus on organic growth, outreach, and reviews first. Ads are an accelerant, not a foundation.

### Budget Guidance
| Phase | Daily Budget | Duration | Purpose |
|-------|-------------|----------|---------|
| Testing | $10-20/day | 2-4 weeks | Learn what keywords convert |
| Validation | $20-50/day | 4-8 weeks | Validate CPC and conversion at scale |
| Growth | $50-100/day | Ongoing | Scale profitable keywords |
| Aggressive | $100+/day | Ongoing | Only after proven ROI |

**Critical rule:** Run campaigns for at least 2 weeks before judging performance. Shorter tests don't have enough data for meaningful conclusions.

### Keyword Strategy

**Segment keywords into separate campaigns** for granular analysis:

| Campaign Type | Keywords | Purpose |
|--------------|----------|---------|
| Brand defense | Your app name, variations | Protect against competitor bidding |
| Category | "[your category] app", "[your category] shopify" | Broad discovery |
| Problem | "[problem you solve]", "how to [task]" | High-intent prospects |
| Competitor | Competitor app names | Capture switchers |
| Long-tail | 3-4 word specific phrases | Lower CPC, higher intent |

**Keyword research from ads:**
- Use the **Search Term Report** to discover which actual search queries trigger your ads
- Mine this data for organic keyword opportunities
- Negative keyword management: exclude irrelevant search terms that waste budget

### Optimization Tactics
- **Start narrow:** Begin with 5-10 highly relevant keywords, expand based on data
- **Bid strategy:** Start at suggested bid, adjust based on impression share
- **Day-parting:** If data shows certain days convert better, allocate budget accordingly
- **Negative keywords:** Add irrelevant triggering terms weekly
- **Landing page = listing:** Your app listing IS your landing page — keep optimizing it

### Measuring Ad Success
| Metric | How to Calculate | Target |
|--------|-----------------|--------|
| CPC | Total spend / clicks | Varies by category |
| CTR | Clicks / impressions | 2%+ |
| Install rate | Installs / clicks | 20%+ |
| Cost per install | Total spend / installs | Below your target CAC |
| ROAS | Revenue from ad installs / ad spend | 3x+ for sustainability |

## Google Ads for Shopify Apps

### Key Constraints
- **Shopify prohibits bidding on the "Shopify" brand keyword** — your ads will be disapproved
- Target problem-based keywords instead: "best [category] app", "how to [solve problem]"
- Landing page should be your Shopify App Store listing or a dedicated page that links to it

### Campaign Setup
- **Campaign type:** Search campaigns for intent-based targeting
- **Bidding:** Start with manual CPC, move to Smart Bidding after 30+ conversions
- **Conversion tracking:** Feed install, subscribe, and payment events via attribution tools (e.g., Prys)
- **Budget:** Start at $20-50/day, requires more patience than App Store ads (longer learning period)

### Smart Bidding with Event Feeds
Once you have enough conversion data:
1. Feed install events as conversions
2. Feed subscription/payment events as high-value conversions
3. Use Target CPA or Target ROAS bidding
4. Smart Bidding optimizes toward users most likely to convert and pay

### Ad Copy Best Practices
- Lead with the merchant pain point, not your app name
- Include social proof ("Trusted by X+ Shopify stores")
- Use sitelink extensions for feature highlights
- Match ad copy to search intent (problem → solution)

## LinkedIn Ads for B2B Apps

### Why LinkedIn for B2B
- 89% of B2B marketers use LinkedIn for lead generation
- Video posts are 20x more likely to be shared than other content
- Precise targeting by job title, company size, and industry
- Higher CPC but higher quality leads for B2B apps

### Targeting Options

| Job title: "Ecommerce Manager", "Store Owner" | Decision makers |
| Company size: 11-50, 51-200 | Mid-market merchants |
| Industry: Retail, Wholesale, Manufacturing | Vertical-specific apps |
| Skills: "Shopify", "Ecommerce" | Shopify-knowledgeable audience |
| Groups: Shopify-related groups | Engaged community members |

### Content Strategy for LinkedIn
| Format | Engagement | Best Use |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| Video (30-60s) | Highest (20x shares) | Product demos, merchant stories |
| Carousel | High | Before/after, step-by-step guides |
| Text post with image | Medium | Insights, tips, metrics sharing |
| Article | Lower but long-lasting | Thought leadership, case studies |

### Budget Guidance
- **Minimum:** $30-50/day (LinkedIn has higher minimum effective spend)
