# Shopify App Store Optimization Guide

## App Store Listing Constraints

### App Name (30 characters max)
Every character is SEO real estate. The app name is the single most important ranking factor for Shopify App Store search. Include your primary keyword naturally — don't keyword-stuff, but don't waste characters on branding alone either.

**Best practices:**
- Lead with the primary keyword if possible (e.g., "QuickCart B2B — Wholesale Ordering")
- Avoid generic words like "App", "Tool", "Pro" unless they add clarity
- Test readability: would a merchant understand what this does from the name alone?
- Character counter: `[____________________________]` (30 chars)

### Subtitle (62 characters max)
Secondary keyword opportunity. The subtitle appears directly below the app name in search results and listing pages. Use it for keywords that didn't fit in the title.

**Best practices:**
- Include 2-3 secondary keywords naturally
- Describe the primary benefit, not features
- Don't repeat keywords already in the title
- Character counter: `[______________________________________________________________]` (62 chars)

### App Introduction (100 characters max)
The value proposition summary that appears in search result cards. This is your elevator pitch in one sentence.

**Best practices:**
- Lead with the outcome, not the feature
- Use merchant language, not developer language
- Example: "Recover lost sales with automated abandoned cart emails that convert" (68 chars)

### Search Terms (up to 20 allowed)
The top keyword typically generates as many searches as the next 10 keywords combined. Prioritize ruthlessly.

**Keyword research methodology:**
1. **Shopify search autocomplete:** Type partial terms in the App Store search bar and note suggestions
2. **Competitor listings:** Analyze titles, subtitles, and descriptions of top competitors
3. **Merchant forums:** Browse Shopify Community, Reddit r/shopify for how merchants describe problems
4. **Support tickets:** If you have existing users, mine support requests for the language they use
5. **Google Trends:** Compare keyword variations to find which terms merchants actually search

**Keyword prioritization:**
| Priority | Criteria | Example |
|----------|----------|---------|
| P1 | High volume, high intent, low competition | "abandoned cart recovery" |
| P2 | Moderate volume, high intent | "cart abandonment email" |
| P3 | Low volume, very high intent (long-tail) | "abandoned cart sms shopify" |
| Skip | High volume, low intent | "marketing" |

## Description Structure

Only 2% of visitors click "more" to read the full description. Above-fold content determines your install rate.

### Above-the-Fold Content (What 98% See)

Use PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solution) or AIDA (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action) framework:

**PAS structure:**
1. **Problem:** Name the specific pain point in merchant language
2. **Agitate:** Quantify the cost of not solving it (lost revenue, wasted time)
3. **Solution:** Your app as the answer, with the key differentiator

**AIDA structure:**
1. **Attention:** Hook with a surprising stat or bold claim
2. **Interest:** Explain what makes your approach different
3. **Desire:** Show the outcome (before/after, metrics improvement)
4. **Action:** Clear CTA — "Add app to start your free trial"

### Full Description (For the 2% Who Click "More")
- Feature list with benefit-oriented headers
- Social proof (review quotes, merchant logos, install count)
- Technical details (integrations, Shopify plan requirements)
- FAQ addressing common objections
- Clear pricing explanation

## Visual Assets

### Screenshots (up to 6)
- First 3 screenshots are visible without scrolling — these are critical
- Annotated screenshots convert better than raw UI captures
- Show the value/outcome, not just the interface
- Add text overlays explaining what the merchant is seeing
- Include before/after comparisons where applicable
- Mobile screenshots matter — merchants browse on phones

### Video
- Strongly preferred over static screenshots by merchants
- Keep to 30-60 seconds — show value immediately in the first 5 seconds
- Don't start with a logo animation or intro — go straight to the app in action
- Show the merchant's workflow, not your feature tour
- Include captions (many watch without sound)

### Interactive Demos
- Interactive demos increase conversion by 20-40%
- Let merchants click through your app before installing
- Focus on the "aha moment" — the first time a merchant sees value

## Built for Shopify Certification

Earning the "Built for Shopify" badge results in a 49% install increase within 14 days of earning the badge. This is one of the highest-ROI activities for any Shopify app.

**Requirements:**
- Meets Shopify's quality standards for UX, performance, and security
- Uses App Bridge for embedded app experience
- Follows Shopify's API best practices
- Passes Shopify's review process

**Priority:** If you don't have the badge, getting it should be near the top of your priority list.

## Listing Changelog

Track every listing change and its impact on conversion rates:

| Date | Change | Views Before | Views After | Install Rate Before | Install Rate After |
|------|--------|-------------|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| | | | | | |

**Best practices:**
- Make one change at a time so you can attribute impact
- Wait 2+ weeks before judging results (need statistical significance)
- Track both views (discovery) and install rate (conversion) separately
- Seasonal effects exist — compare same day of week
