## Reviews & Social Proof

### Reviews Needed for Organic Discovery
- **Minimum threshold:** 20-60 reviews for meaningful organic App Store discovery
- **Users per review:** Expect 33-100 active users per organic review
- **Review velocity matters:** Steady stream > burst of reviews

### Review Milestones
| Milestone | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| First 5 reviews | Social proof baseline — merchants consider the app |
| 10 reviews | Appears more credible in search results |
| 20 reviews | Begins generating meaningful organic installs |
| 50 reviews | Strong organic discovery, virtuous cycle begins |
| 100+ reviews | Category leader perception |

### Review Rating Impact
- One 1-star review can cut daily installs in half
- Below 4.0 stars significantly reduces install willingness
- 4.5+ stars is the sweet spot — perceived as high quality without seeming fake

## Time-to-Milestone Benchmarks (Realistic)

These are realistic timelines for a solo developer with moderate marketing effort:

| Milestone | Timeline | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| First install | Week 2-3 | From friends, outreach, or community posts |
| First review | Month 1 | Often from beta users or early adopters |
| 10 active installs | Month 2-3 | Requires consistent listing optimization and outreach |
| 50 active installs | Month 6 | Organic discovery begins to contribute |
| 100 active installs | Month 9-12 | Multiple channels working |
| First $1K MRR | Month 8 | Depends heavily on pricing model |

**Reality check:** The median first-three-month revenue for a new Shopify app is $0. These timelines assume active marketing effort, not just "publish and hope."

## Cost Benchmarks

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
| Rating | CAC | Notes |
|--------|-----|-------|
| Good | <$20 | Organic + targeted outreach |
| Average | $20-50 | Mix of paid and organic |
| Poor | $50+ | Over-reliance on paid channels or poor targeting |

### Channel Costs
| Channel | Typical Cost | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Organic App Store | $0 | Free but requires ASO investment |
| Cold outreach | $0-5/prospect | Time cost + optional tools |
| Content/SEO | $0 (time) | Compounds over time, 3-6 month payoff |
| App Store Ads | $10-20/day starting | CPC varies by competition |
| Google Ads | $20-50/day starting | Higher CPC, broader reach |
| LinkedIn (B2B) | $30-50/day starting | Best for B2B apps |
| Partnerships | $0 (commission) | Revenue share on referrals |
