# Partnership & Channel Development Playbook

## Partnership Types

### 1. Complementary App Developers
Apps that serve the same merchants but solve different problems. The most natural partnership type.

**Opportunities:**
- **Cross-promotion:** Mention each other in app descriptions, blog posts, and onboarding
- **Bundle deals:** Offer discounts when merchants install both apps
- **Integration partnerships:** Build direct integrations that make both apps more valuable
- **Shared content:** Co-author comparison guides, webinars, or case studies

**How to identify complementary apps:**
- Look at what other apps your best merchants use
- Search the App Store for apps that frequently appear alongside yours
- Think about the merchant's full workflow — what happens before and after they use your app?

**Example:** A shipping app partners with an inventory management app — same merchants, different needs.

### 2. Shopify Agencies & Consultants
Agencies set up and manage stores for merchants. They're trusted advisors who recommend apps.

**Partnership model:**
- **Referral commission:** 20-30% monthly recurring commission for each merchant they refer
- **White-glove onboarding:** Provide premium setup support for their clients
- **Priority support:** Dedicated support channel for agency-referred merchants
- **Co-branded materials:** Landing pages, case studies, and presentations they can use with clients

**Finding agencies:**
- Shopify Partners directory
- LinkedIn: Search "Shopify agency" or "Shopify partner"
- Shopify Community: Agency-focused threads
- Agency directories: Storetasker, HeyCarson, Shopify Experts marketplace

**What agencies want:**
- Apps that make their clients successful (reduces churn from their services)
- Reliable apps that don't break stores or cause support tickets
- Commission for referrals (they need to monetize recommendations)
- Responsive support (their reputation is on the line)

### 3. Industry Experts & Educators
Course creators, YouTubers, newsletter writers, and podcast hosts who teach merchants.

**Partnership model:**
- **Affiliate commission:** Per-install or per-paid-conversion commission
- **Sponsored content:** Pay for mentions in their content (be transparent)
- **Guest content:** Write for their blog or appear on their podcast
- **Free access:** Give them full access to create tutorials and reviews
- **Exclusive offers:** Special deal for their audience

**Finding experts:**
- YouTube: Search "Shopify [your category] tutorial"
- Podcasts: Search Shopify-focused shows
- Newsletters: Shopify-focused email newsletters
- Course platforms: Udemy, Skillshare courses on Shopify
- Social media: Twitter/X #shopifydev, LinkedIn Shopify groups

### 4. Technology Partners
Platforms and tools that integrate with Shopify where a partnership creates mutual value.

**Examples:**
- Email marketing platforms (Klaviyo, Mailchimp)
- Analytics tools
- Payment providers
- Shipping carriers

## PartnerJam for Affiliate Programs

**When to set up:**

| Contacted | Sent initial outreach | Day 0 |
| Responded | Got a reply (positive or neutral) | Day 3-14 |

| Declined | They said no or didn't respond after follow-up | — |

**Pipeline hygiene:**
