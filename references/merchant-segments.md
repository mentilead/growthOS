# Merchant Segmentation & ICP Development

## Segmentation Dimensions

### By Shopify Plan
| Plan | Typical Revenue | Characteristics | App Spend Behavior |
|------|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Starter | $0-1K/mo | Side project, testing the waters | Free apps only |
| Basic | $1K-10K/mo | Early traction, bootstrapped | $0-50/mo on apps |
| Shopify | $10K-50K/mo | Growing, investing in operations | $50-200/mo on apps |
| Advanced | $50K-200K/mo | Established, optimization-focused | $200-500/mo on apps |
| Plus | $200K+/mo | Enterprise, dedicated team | $500+/mo, custom needs |

**Targeting guidance:** Most B2C apps find the sweet spot at Basic-Shopify plans. B2B apps often target Advanced-Plus. Starter plan merchants rarely convert to paid apps.

### By Vertical
| Vertical | Avg Conversion Rate | Key Characteristics |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Fashion & Apparel | 1.8-2.5% | High return rates, visual-heavy, seasonal |
| Food & Beverage | 3-5% | Subscription potential, repeat purchase, local delivery |
| Electronics | 0.8-1.5% | High AOV, research-heavy buying cycle, comparison shopping |
| Home & Garden | 1.5-2.5% | Seasonal, room for upsell, visual merchandising matters |
| Beauty & Cosmetics | 2-3.5% | High repeat rate, subscription potential, influencer-driven |
| Health & Wellness | 2-3% | Subscription-friendly, trust-sensitive, regulation-aware |
| B2B / Wholesale | Variable | Longer sales cycle, higher AOV, custom pricing needs |

### By Technical Sophistication
| Level | Description | App Preferences |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| Plug-and-play | Uses default theme, minimal customization | Simple setup, no code, guided onboarding |
| Theme customizer | Modifies theme settings, uses page builders | Some configuration OK, visual editors preferred |
| App power user | Uses 10+ apps, comfortable with integrations | Feature-rich, API access, automation |
| Headless/API-first | Custom storefront, developer-driven | API-first, documentation quality matters |

### By Business Stage
| Stage | Timeline | Key Needs | Marketing Approach |
|-------|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| New | <6 months | Everything — still figuring out product-market fit | Education-first, low commitment |
| Growing | 6mo-2yr | Scaling operations, fixing bottlenecks | Problem-solution, ROI-focused |
| Established | 2-5yr | Optimization, efficiency, competitive edge | Feature comparison, integration depth |
| Enterprise | 5yr+ | Custom solutions, dedicated support | White-glove, partnership model |

### B2B vs B2C vs Hybrid
| Type | Characteristics | Marketing Approach |
|------|----------------|-------------------|
| B2C | Higher volume, lower AOV, emotional buying | App Store discovery, social proof, easy onboarding |
| B2B | Lower volume, higher AOV, rational buying | Outreach, partnerships, case studies, demos |
| Hybrid | Sells to both consumers and businesses | Segment messaging, flexible pricing |

## ICP Worksheet — Value Proposition Canvas

Use the Value Proposition Canvas to map your app's value to your customer's world:

### Customer Side

**Customer Jobs (what they're trying to accomplish):**
- Functional jobs:
- Emotional jobs:
- Social jobs:

**Pains (what frustrates them about current solutions):**
- Obstacles:
- Risks:
- Undesired outcomes:

**Gains (what outcomes they want):**
- Required gains:
- Expected gains:
- Desired gains:
- Unexpected gains:

### Your App Side

**Pain Relievers (how your app addresses their pains):**
-

**Gain Creators (how your app delivers gains):**
-

**Fit Assessment:**
- Which pains does your app relieve most effectively?
- Which gains does your app create uniquely?
- Where is the strongest fit between customer needs and your capabilities?

## ICP Validation Methods

Don't assume your ICP — validate it with real data:

### 1. Shopify Community Forums
- Search for merchants describing problems your app solves
- Note the language they use (this becomes your marketing copy)
- Look at their store URLs to understand their segment

### 2. Reddit r/shopify and r/shopifyappdev
- Monitor "looking for app" and "recommendation" threads
- Identify recurring pain points in your category
- Note which solutions merchants mention (your competitors)

### 3. Competitor App Reviews
- Read 1-star and 2-star reviews of competitors
- These reveal unmet needs your app could address
- Note the merchant type complaining (your potential ICP)

### 4. Social Listening
- Twitter/X: Search "[competitor name] shopify" for complaints
- Facebook Groups: Shopify entrepreneur groups
- LinkedIn: Shopify Partners discussions

### 5. Direct Research
- Interview 5-10 merchants in your target segment
- Ask about their workflow, not about your app
- Use JTBD interview framework (see jtbd-research template)
