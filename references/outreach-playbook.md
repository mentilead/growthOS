# Cold Outreach Playbook for Shopify Apps

## Outreach Reality Check

Merchants receive 20+ cold emails daily from app developers. Personalization is non-negotiable — generic templates get deleted instantly.

### Conversion Benchmarks
| Targeting Strategy | Expected Conversion | Notes |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------|
| Random cold email | 1-2% | Not worth the effort at scale |
| Category-targeted | 3-5% | Better but still generic |
| Competitor uninstall targeting | 15-25% | Highest conversion — they have the problem AND just lost a solution |
| Post-support-ticket outreach | 10-15% | They've shown the pain signal |
| Community engagement first | 8-12% | Warm outreach after adding value |

## Email Rules

### The Non-Negotiables
1. **Under 100 words.** Merchants skim. Every word must earn its place.
2. **Plain text.** No HTML templates, no images, no formatting. Looks like a real person wrote it.
3. **Personalized.** Reference something specific about their store — a product, a design choice, a recent change.
4. **No links in the first email.** Links trigger spam filters and feel salesy. First email is about starting a conversation.
5. **Max 3 emails in a sequence.** More than 3 is harassment. Space them 3-5 days apart.
6. **Clear opt-out.** Make it easy to say "not interested" — respect the response.

### Subject Line Rules
- Under 50 characters
- No ALL CAPS, no excessive punctuation, no emojis
- Personalized when possible (store name, category reference)
- Question format or observation format converts best
- A/B test subject lines across campaigns

## Prospect Research

### Finding the Right Merchants

**Tools:**
- **StoreCensus:** Discover Shopify stores by technology, traffic, and category
- **BuiltWith:** See what apps and technologies a store uses
- **Manual research:** Browse stores in your target category, check their app usage

**Finding Decision Makers:**
- **LinkedIn:** Search "[store name] + Shopify" or "[store name] + ecommerce"
- **About page:** Many stores list team members
- **WHOIS:** Domain registration data (less reliable but sometimes useful)
- **Contact page:** Often reveals the owner for smaller stores

### Qualification Signals
Before reaching out, verify:
- [ ] Store is active (recent products, active social media)
- [ ] Store is in your target segment (right size, right vertical)
- [ ] Store shows indicators of needing your app
- [ ] Decision maker contact is findable
- [ ] Store doesn't already use your app or a direct competitor

## Email Template Structures

### Structure 1: Problem-First
```
Subject: [Specific observation about their store]

Hi [Name],

I noticed [specific thing about their store that relates to a problem you solve].

[One sentence about the cost/impact of this problem].

[One sentence about how your approach is different].

Would it be helpful if I [specific offer of value]?

[Your name]
```

### Structure 2: Insight-First
```
Subject: Quick thought on [their store/category]

Hi [Name],

I've been looking at [their vertical] stores on Shopify and noticed
that [relevant insight or trend].

[One sentence about what top stores in their category do differently].

We built [app name] to help with exactly this — [one benefit statement].

Happy to share more if useful.

[Your name]
```

### Structure 3: Competitor Migration
```
Subject: Switching from [competitor]?

Hi [Name],

I noticed you recently [removed/changed] [competitor app].

[One sentence acknowledging a common frustration with that competitor].

We built [app name] specifically to solve [the problem they had].
[One proof point — review quote, metric, or feature advantage].

Want me to show you how the switch works? Takes about [time].

[Your name]
```

## Sequence Timing

### Email 1 (Day 0) — Value First, No Links
- Purpose: Start a conversation, demonstrate knowledge of their situation
- No links, no CTAs beyond "would this be helpful?"
- Under 100 words

### Email 2 (Day 3-5) — Gentle Follow-up
- Purpose: Add a new insight or angle, not just "following up"
- Can include a brief case study or metric
- Still under 100 words
- One soft link OK (to a blog post, not your app listing)

### Email 3 (Day 8-10) — Final Touch
- Purpose: Last attempt, direct but respectful
- Include the app link
- Acknowledge you don't want to be pushy
- Make it easy to say no

## Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do)

### Never Do This
- **Generic templates:** "Hi there, I have an app that..." — instant delete
- **Feature dumps:** Listing 10 features nobody asked about
- **Fake urgency:** "Limited time offer" or "Spots are filling up"
- **Asking for time without giving value:** "Can I get 15 minutes of your time?" — no
- **Targeting wrong stores:** A shipping app email to a digital goods store
- **Mass emails with no personalization:** BCC blasts or obvious mail merge failures
- **Following up more than 3 times:** This is harassment
- **Sending on weekends:** Merchants are humans too
- **Long emails:** If it's over 100 words, it's too long for cold outreach

### Common Mistakes
- Personalizing only the name (merchants can tell)
- Focusing on features instead of outcomes
- Not researching if they already use a competitor
- Sending from a generic email (noreply@, info@)
- No clear next step or too many next steps
