## Shopify Data Accuracy Standards

GrowthOS differentiates itself through Shopify-specific intelligence. Every benchmark, constraint, and recommendation must be grounded in real ecosystem data.

### Data Requirements
- All benchmarks must come from Shopify ecosystem sources (App Store data, developer surveys, published research).
- Cite the source implicitly in context (e.g., "Shopify App Store limits titles to 30 characters") rather than with footnotes.
- When data is approximate or ranges, say so: "typically 15-25%" not "exactly 20%".
- Never invent benchmarks. If we don't have data for something, say "no reliable benchmark available" and recommend the user track their own baseline.

### Constraint Accuracy
These are hard limits from the Shopify App Store — must be exact:
- App name: 30 characters
- Subtitle: 62 characters
- App introduction: 100 characters
- Search terms: 20 maximum
- Screenshots: 6 maximum

### Benchmark Ranges
Benchmarks are presented as ranges, not precise numbers, because they vary by category:
- View to Add App: average 20%, good 30-40%
- Install complete rate: average 60-70%, good 80%+
- Trial to paid: average 10-20%, good 20%+

### Tone
- Honest, not optimistic. "The median first-three-month revenue is $0" is the kind of truth we include.
- Opinionated with defaults: "Your install rate of 15% is below the 20% average."
- Override-able: defaults should be right for 80% of cases, but users can customize everything.
