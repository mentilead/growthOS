## Mood Check Framework
| Score | Energy Label | Satisfaction Label |
|-------|--------------|--------------------|
| 1 | Exhausted | Frustrated |
| 2 | Low energy | Discouraged |
| 3 | Okay | Neutral |
| 4 | Good energy | Satisfied |
| 5 | Energized | Thriving |

## Burnout Advisory Triggers
- Energy <= 2 OR Satisfaction <= 2: suggest reducing scope, focus on one high-ROI channel
- Both <= 2: strong advisory to take a break, "marketing is a marathon not a sprint"
- Both >= 4: encouragement and acknowledgment of momentum
