# Phase 12: Documentation, README & Community Launch — Plan

## Context
Phase 12 is the final implementation phase. All 11 skills and 3 commands are built. This phase enhances the README to professional launch quality and adds community/contributor infrastructure.

## Scope
- Enhance README with commands section, skills guide, recommended workflow, contributing, built-with
- Create CONTRIBUTING.md with skill/command creation guides
- Create GitHub issue templates (bug report, feature request, new skill idea)
- Create LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md (gitignored) for external launch tasks
- Update roadmap and bump version to 0.9.0

## Decisions
1. Version 0.9.0 — pre-1.0 until after community launch
2. LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md gitignored (personal task tracking)
3. External launch tasks tracked in checklist only
4. README restructured to follow Problem → Install → Demo → Docs pattern
