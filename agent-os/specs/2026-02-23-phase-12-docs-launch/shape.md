# Phase 12: Documentation, README & Community Launch — Shape

## What We're Doing
Enhancing the existing README and adding community infrastructure for open-source launch.

## What We're NOT Doing
- Creating GIF demos (external task, tracked in launch checklist)
- Submitting to registries (external task)
- Writing blog posts or community posts (external task)
- Bumping to 1.0 (waiting for community feedback)

## Key Shapes

### README Structure
Problem → Install → Demo → Commands → Skills Guide → Workflow → How It Works → Contributing → Built With

### CONTRIBUTING.md
~80 lines covering: adding skills, adding commands, improving reference data, bug reporting, development setup.

### Issue Templates
Three templates: bug report, feature request, new skill idea. All use GitHub YAML frontmatter.

### LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md
Comprehensive checklist of all external launch tasks from roadmap 12.2. Gitignored.
