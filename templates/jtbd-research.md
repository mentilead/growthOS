# Jobs-to-be-Done Research

## JTBD Framework
Merchants don't buy apps — they "hire" them to accomplish specific jobs.

### Three Dimensions
1. **Functional Job:** The practical task (e.g., "recover abandoned carts")
2. **Emotional Job:** How they want to feel (e.g., "confident they're not leaving money on the table")
3. **Social Job:** How they want to appear (e.g., "running a professional operation")

## Switching Moment Forces
For each interview/observation, map the four forces:

### Force 1: Push (frustration with current solution)
-

### Force 2: Pull (attraction of new solution)
-

### Force 3: Anxiety (fear of switching)
-

### Force 4: Habit (inertia keeping them on current solution)
-
