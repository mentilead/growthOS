# Experiment Backlog

## Scoring Guide
- **Impact (I):** How much will this move the needle? (1=tiny, 10=game-changing)
- **Confidence (C):** How sure are we this will work? (1=wild guess, 10=proven pattern)
- **Ease (E):** How easy to execute? (1=months of work, 10=done in an hour)
- **ICE Score:** Average of I + C + E

## Active Queue (sorted by ICE score descending)
| ID | App | Experiment | I | C | E | ICE | Status | Channel |
|----|-----|-----------|---|---|---|-----|--------|---------|
| | | | | | | | | |

## Completed
| ID | Experiment | Result | Key Learning |
|----|-----------|--------|--------------|
| | | | |

## Parked (good ideas, not now)
| ID | Experiment | Reason Parked |
|----|-----------|---------------|

## Rules
- Keep 20% of experiments as "big swings" (high impact, low confidence)
- Default experiment duration: 2-4 weeks
- Review backlog weekly during /growthOS-review
- Maximum 3 active experiments at once (solo developer constraint)
